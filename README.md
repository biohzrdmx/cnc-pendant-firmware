Arduino CNC pendant for UGS

## Overview

Create a handy CNC pendant for UGS running on an Arduino Pro Micro.

### BOM

- Arduino Pro Micro (5V, 16MHz)
- KY-040 Rotary encoder
- 5 Push buttons (self-locking)
- SSD1306 0.96 inch OLED display (I2C)

### Connections

- Button X       Pin 4
- Button Y       Pin 5
- Button Z       Pin 6
- Button RANGE   Pin 10
- Button STOP    Pin 16
- Encoder Switch Pin 7
- Encoder A      Pin 8
- Encoder B      Pin 9
- SSD1306 SDA    Pin 2
- SSD1306 SCL    Pin 3

### Hotkeys

When executing an action on the pendant it will generate a hotkey-press to interface with UGS, the following is a list of these actions/hotkeys:

**Single press**

- Button X       - _none_ - Change axis to X
- Button Y       - _none_ - Change axis to Y
- Button Z       - _none_ - Change axis to Z
- Button RANGE   - CTRL+SHIFT+_n_ - Change step size (0.001 mm, 0.01 mm, 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm), _n_ is numbers 1 to 5
- Button STOP    - CTRL+SHIFT+S - Stop
- Encoder Switch - CTRL+SHIFT+U - Unlock

**Long press**

- Button X       - CTRL+SHIFT+X - Reset X zero
- Button Y       - CTRL+SHIFT+Y - Reset Y zero
- Button Z       - CTRL+SHIFT+Z - Reset Z zero
- Button RANGE   - CTRL+SHIFT+H - Return to XY zero
- Button STOP    - CTRL+SHIFT+R - Soft reset
- Encoder Switch - CTRL+SHIFT+A - Reset XYZ zero

**Encoder rotation**

- Clock-wise         - For axis X LEFT  - For axis Y DOWN - For axis Z SHIFT + DOWN
- Counter-clock-wise - For axis X RIGHT - For axis Y UP   - For axis Z SHIFT + UP
